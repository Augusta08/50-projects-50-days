# Form Wave Animation

An input form with a wave-like label animation. When you focus on an input, each letter in the label rises smoothly one after another, creating a ripple effect across the text.

## What I Practiced

- Splitting text into individual `<span>` elements for letter-based animations.
- Using CSS `transform` and `transition-delay` to create a sequential wave effect.
- Handling `focus` events in JavaScript to toggle active states.
