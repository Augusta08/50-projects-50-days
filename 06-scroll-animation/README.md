# Scroll Animation

A simple scroll-triggered animation where boxes slide in smoothly from alternating sides as the user scrolls down the page. The effect adds motion and interactivity to an otherwise static layout.

## What I Practiced

- Using getBoundingClientRect() to check an elementâ€™s position relative to the viewport.
- Applying and removing classes dynamically with JavaScript to trigger CSS transitions.
- Implementing scroll-based animations without any external libraries.
- Using transform and transition properties for smooth slide-in effects.
