# Sound Board

A simple and fun sound board that plays different audio clips when you click the buttons. Only one sound plays at a time, creating a clean and smooth interaction without overlapping noises.

## What I Practiced

- Playing and pausing audio elements dynamically with JavaScript.
- Resetting an audio clipâ€™s playback position using currentTime.
- Managing state to prevent multiple sounds from playing at once.
- Basic layout and styling using Flexbox.
